# Function, recursion programming exercises and solutions in C
A function is a collection of statements grouped together to do some specific task. In series of learning C programming, we already used many functions unknowingly. Functions such as - printf(), scanf(), sqrt(), pow() or the most important the main() function. Every C program has at least one function i.e. the main() function.

Function provides modularity to our program. Dividing a program in different modules makes it easy to maintain, debug and understand the code.

Functions in C programming is classified in two categories i.e. library functions and user defined functions. In this exercise we will focus on user defined functions and learn to write our own functions.
