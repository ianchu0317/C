Test Data :
Input the number of nodes : 3
Input data for node 1 : 1
Input data for node 2 : 2
Input data for node 3 : 3
Expected Output :

 Data entered in the list are :                                                                               
 Data = 1                                                                                                     
 Data = 2                                                                                                     
 Data = 3                                                                                                     
                                                                                                              
 The new list after deletion the last node are  :                                                             
 Data = 1                                                                                                     
 Data = 2
