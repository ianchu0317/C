#Task 
'''
Write a program in C to demonstrate how to handle the pointers in the program

Expected Output :

Address of m : 0x7ffcc3ad291c
 Value of m : 29                                                                                              
                                                                                                              
 Now ab is assigned with the address of m.                                                                    
 Address of pointer ab : 0x7ffcc3ad291c                                                                       
 Content of pointer ab : 29                                                                                   
                                                                                                              
 The value of m assigned to 34 now.                                                                           
 Address of pointer ab : 0x7ffcc3ad291c                                                                       
 Content of pointer ab : 34                                                                                   
                                                                                                              
 The pointer variable ab is assigned with the value 7 now.                                                    
 Address of m : 0x7ffcc3ad291c                                                                                
 Value of m : 7
