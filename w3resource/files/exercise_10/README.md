Write a program in C to append multiple lines at the end of a text file. Go to the editor

Assume that the content of the file test.txt is :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4                                                                                                   

Test Data :
Input the file name to be opened : test.txt
Input the number of lines to be written : 3
The lines are :
test line 5
test line 6
test line 7


Expected Output :

The content of the file test.txt is  :
