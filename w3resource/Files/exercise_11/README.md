Write a program in C to copy a file in another name.0

Assume that the content of the file test.txt is :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4                                                                                                   

Test Data :
Input the source file name : test.txt
Input the new file name : test1.txt
Expected Output :

 The file test.txt  copied successfully in the file test1.txt.

If you read the new file you will see the content of the file :

test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4
