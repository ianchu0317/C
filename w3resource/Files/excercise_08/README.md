Write a program in C to delete a specific line from a file.

Assume that the content of the file test.txt is :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 2                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4                                                                                                   

Test Data :
Input the file name to be opened : test.txt
Input the line you want to remove : 2

Expected Output :

 The content of the file test.txt is :                                                                       
test line 1                                                                                                   
test line 3                                                                                                   
test line 4
